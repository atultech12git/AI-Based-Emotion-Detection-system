This project implements an AI-based Emotion Detection System using Deep Learning and Computer Vision to recognize human facial emotions from images and real-time webcam input.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on the FER-2013 dataset to classify six emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral, and disgust.

The trained model is integrated with Python and OpenCV to enable real-time emotion prediction through a live camera feed.
The system detects faces, processes them frame-by-frame, and displays the predicted emotion instantly.
This project demonstrates practical use of deep learning for affective computing and real-time AI applications.

The Emotion Detection System can be applied in human–computer interaction, mental health analysis, emotion-aware systems, and intelligent monitoring solutions.
